# ZAU API (Thoth)

This documentation is rough, and will be improved over time.

## Introduction

Thoth is the Ancient Egyption god of Knowledge.  This API will serve as the monolithic API for the new ZAU web services.

## Building

For right now, make build and make clean are the only two commands that are used to build. It will soon be containerized and a CI/CD flow added.

## Running

After building, run with ./thoth run.  You can use ./thoth -h or ./thoth help to view the command help
